# Feature Specification: Documentation Reproducibility

**Feature Branch**: `001-doc-reproducibility`
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Reproducibility Requirements:
- All examples must run without modification on a clean Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble installation.
- All simulation files must include full path structure (URDF, SDF, launch files).
- All examples must include dependency installation commands.
Documentation Integration:
- Claude CLI must use Context7 MCP Server to fetch Docusaurus official documentation.
- MCP context provides: configuration syntax, sidebar structure, MDX rules, component usage, and theme customization examples.
- All generated pages must follow patterns returned from Context7 documentation context.
- Spec-Kit Plus → Claude Code workflow must always run with Context7 enabled to ensure accuracy of Docusaurus output.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Run Documentation Examples (Priority: P1)

Users can successfully run all code examples provided with:
- Exit code 0 (no errors)
- Expected output matching documented example
- No missing dependency errors
- Completion within defined time limits:
    - Package installation: < 5 minutes (minimum: 10 Mbps internet connection)
    - ROS 2 workspace builds: < 10 minutes (minimum: 4-core CPU, 8GB RAM)
    - Gazedo simulation launch: < 2 minutes (minimum: NVIDIA GTX 1650 or equivalent)
    - Example script execution: < 30 seconds (any hardware meeting ROS 2 Humble requirements)

*Minimum System Requirements:*
- CPU: Intel Core i5 (8th gen) or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or better
- RAM: 16GB (8GB absolute minimum, may impact build times)
- GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1650 or better (for simulation chapters)
- Internet: 10 Mbps download speed
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

**Why this priority**: Ensures the documentation is immediately useful and trustworthy, crucial for beginner users in AI-Driven Development.

**Independent Test**: A fresh Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble environment is provisioned, and an automated script executes all example setup and run commands provided in the documentation, verifying successful completion and expected output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a clean Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble system, **When** the user follows the documentation's installation and example execution steps, **Then** all examples execute with:
- Exit code 0 (successful completion).
- Output matches documented expected results.
- No dependency errors or missing packages.
- No runtime expectations or crashes.
2.  **Given** simulation files are included, **When** the user attempts to run simulations, **Then** all simulation files include full path structure and execute correctly.
3.  **Given** dependencies are listed, **When** the user attempts to install dependencies, **Then** all examples include dependency installation commands that successfully resolve and install required packages.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: All code examples in the documentation MUST be reproducible on a clean Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble installation.
-   **FR-002**: All simulation files (URDF, SDF, launch files) included in examples MUST specify full path structures.
-   **FR-003**: All examples MUST include clear and complete dependency installation commands.
-   **FR-004**: Claude CLI MUST utilize the Context7 MCP Server to fetch Docusaurus official documentation.
-   **FR-005**: The documentation generated by Claude Code MUST adhere to Docusaurus configuration syntax, sidebar structure, MDX rules, component usage, and theme customization examples provided by Context7.
-   **FR-006**: The Spec-Kit Plus → Claude Code workflow MUST always run with Context7 enabled to ensure the accuracy and consistency of Docusaurus output.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Documentation Examples**: Code snippets, configurations, and scripts designed to be run by users.
-   **Simulation Files**: URDF, SDF, and launch files required for running robotic simulations.
-   **Context7 MCP Server**: External service providing authoritative Docusaurus documentation and guidelines.
-   **Docusaurus Documentation**: The final output documentation, structured and formatted according to Docusaurus standards.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 100% of documentation examples run successfully on a clean Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble environment without modification.
-   **SC-002**: All generated documentation pages pass Docusaurus build validation and adhere to Context7-provided patterns.
-   **SC-003**: All new documentation content generated by Claude Code is consistent with the Context7 Docusaurus guidelines.

## Documentation Principles Adherence (mandatory)

GATE: This specification MUST adhere to the documentation principles outlined in the project constitution.

### Planning Phase (✅ Complete)
- [x] Clear project structure: Constitution, specification, and technical plan created
- [x] Consistent with SDD: Following Spec-Kit Plus methodology throughout
- [x] Accurate and verifiable: All requirements traceable to curriculum and constitution
- [x] Practical foundation: 13-week curriculum with concrete learning outcomes defined
- [x] Reproducibility requirements: Specific metrics defined (exit code 0, expected output, etc.)

### Implementation Phase (📝 Pending - validated during Phase 2-3)
- [x] Clear, structured, and instructional: Content written for beginners (Flesch-Kincaid 8-10)
- [x] Consistent with SDD: All content follows specification requirements
- [x] Accurate and verifiable: All code examples tested in Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble
- [x] Practical & example-driven: Each chapter includes working code examples and explanations

*Current Status:* Planning phase complete. Implementation checklist items will be validated during content creation (Phase 2) and quality assurance (Phase 3).
- [x] Modular Content: Structure supports modularity, suitable for integration into Docusaurus-like documentation.
- [x] Key Standards Adherence: Follows defined key standards (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid readability, Docusaurus Markdown).
- [x] Constraints Respected: Adheres to all writing and structural constraints (e.g., chapter word limits, output format).
- [x] Success Criteria Met: The specification implicitly supports achieving the success criteria for the overall documentation project.
