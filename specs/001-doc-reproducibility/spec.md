# Feature Specification: Documentation Reproducibility

**Feature Branch**: `001-doc-reproducibility`
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Reproducibility Requirements:
- All examples must run without modification on a clean Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble installation.
- All simulation files must include full path structure (URDF, SDF, launch files).
- All examples must include dependency installation commands.
Documentation Integration:
- Claude CLI must use Context7 MCP Server to fetch Docusaurus official documentation.
- MCP context provides: configuration syntax, sidebar structure, MDX rules, component usage, and theme customization examples.
- All generated pages must follow patterns returned from Context7 documentation context.
- Spec-Kit Plus → Claude Code workflow must always run with Context7 enabled to ensure accuracy of Docusaurus output.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Run Documentation Examples (Priority: P1)

Users can successfully run all code examples provided with:
- Exit code 0 (no errors)
- Expected output matching documented example
- No missing dependency errors
- Completion within defined time limits:
    - Package installation: < 5 minutes >= 10 Mbps internet connection
    - ROS 2 workspace builds: < 10 minutes >= 4-core CPU, 8GB RAM
    - Gazedo simulation launch: < 2 minutes on a GPU >= NVIDIA GTX 1650
        - Gazebo simulation launch (simple robot, empty world): < 2 minutes (minimum: NVIDIA GTX 1650 4GB)
        - Gazebo simulation launch (complex humanoid, physics-rich environment): < 5 minutes (recommended: NVIDIA RTX 3060 6GB or better)
        - Isaac Sim basic scene load: < 3 minutes (minimum: NVIDIA RTX 3070 8GB)
        - Isaac Sim complex scene with multiple robots: Performance may vary; recommended: NVIDIA RTX 4070 12GB or better
    - Example script execution: < 30 seconds on ROS 2 Humble requirements

*Note on GPU Requirements:*
- Simple Gazebo examples (Weeks 6-7): NVIDIA GTX 1650 4GB is sufficient
- Advanced simulations (Weeks 8-10): NVIDIA RTX 3070 8GB minimum recommended
- Isaac Sim chapters (Weeks 8-10): NVIDIA RTX 3070+ required; cloud alternatives documented for users without suitable GPU
- Performance times may vary ±30% based on background processes and system configuration

*Minimum System Requirements:*
- CPU: Intel Core i5 (8th gen) or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or better
- RAM: 16GB (8GB absolute minimum, may impact build times)
- GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1650 or better (for simulation chapters)
- Internet: 10 Mbps download speed
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

**Why this priority**: Ensures the documentation is immediately useful and trustworthy, crucial for beginner users in AI-Driven Development.

**Independent Test**: A fresh Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble environment is provisioned, and an automated script executes all example setup and run commands provided in the documentation, verifying successful completion and expected output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a clean Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble system, **When** the user follows the documentation's installation and example execution steps, **Then** all examples execute with:
- Exit code 0 (successful completion).
- Output matches documented expected results.
- No dependency errors or missing packages.
- No runtime expectations or crashes.
2.  **Given** simulation files are included, **When** the user attempts to run simulations, **Then** all simulation files include full path structure and execute correctly.
3.  **Given** dependencies are listed, **When** the user attempts to install dependencies, **Then** all examples include dependency installation commands that successfully resolve and install required packages.
